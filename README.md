# Turtle-Crossing

An early Python program of mine, initially made on Replit.com and used the "100 Days of Python Coding" course by Angela Yu on Udemy.

Just run the main.py file, press (or hold) "W" to move the turtle up, and try not to get hit by the cars! Each level increases the speed of the cars.
